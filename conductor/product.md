# Product Definition: AudioSequencer AI

## Vision
A professional-grade audio sequencing environment that leverages local AI models to automate the technical hurdles of music production—tempo matching, harmonic alignment, and track discovery—allowing creators to focus on the "flow" and semantic context of their sound.

## Core Value Propositions
1. **Semantic Discovery:** Find audio not just by filename, but by vibe, instrument, and emotional quality using CLAP embeddings.
2. **Technical Automation:** Real-time BPM and Key detection with high-quality time-stretching and pitch-shifting.
3. **Intelligent Sequencing:** Recommendations based on a multi-dimensional "Compatibility Score" (BPM + Key + Semantic Vibe).
4. **Local-First Privacy:** All AI analysis and generation (CLAP, MusicGen) runs locally on the user's hardware.

## Target Audience
- Loop-based producers and DJs.
- Sound designers managing large libraries of 30-second clips.
- Content creators needing fast, high-quality background audio transitions.

## Success Metrics
- **Accuracy:** Accurate BPM (within 0.5%) and Key detection.
- **Performance:** Sub-second retrieval for semantic search in libraries up to 10,000 clips.
- **Quality:** Artifact-free audio manipulation using professional-grade DSP libraries.
